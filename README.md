OSGi example project, based on BND with Maven

Case study for http://OpenDaylight.org with http://bndtools.org (http://bnd.bndtools.org)

I'd like ODL to eventually adopt Gradle, but that will be a separate project, so try Maven, for now.

Originally initiated by Michael Vorburger.ch (@ work @ Red Hat),
together with Kai Kreuzer, during Unconference day at EclipseCon France 2016.
